In Quantum Mechanics we define Quantum Systems by using the wavefunction (Ψ), which is a vector.
For example :– \|Ψ> = a \|0> + b \|1> + c \|2> ......
Here what we write in **“ket”** notation (\|>) are the possible quantum states and their coefficients are the probabilities for the particular states; these coefficients are complex numbers.

According to the **Born Interpretation** the square of the coefficients are the probabilities and also the sum of all the probabilities is 1. Let’s take an example :

**\|Ψ> = a\|0> + b\|1>**

now the probability of measuring state 0 = a.a*
and the probability of measuring state 1 = b.b*

__* = complex conjugate__

Now in order to understand decoherence let’s consider the system to be in superposition.

**\|Ψ> = (1/√2) \|0> + (1/√2) \|1>**
probability of \|0> = 1/2
probability of \|1> = 1/2

If we add a complex number $$ \exp^{iθ} $$ then it will not affect the probabilities because if it’s product with it’s conjugate will be 1.

$$ \frac{cos(x)}_{sin(x)} $$
