I"|<p>In Quantum Mechanics we define Quantum Systems by using the wavefunction (Ψ), which is a vector.
For example :– |Ψ&gt; = a |0&gt; + b |1&gt; + c |2&gt; ……
Here what we write in <strong>“ket”</strong> notation (|&gt;) are the possible quantum states and their coefficients are the probabilities for the particular states; these coefficients are complex numbers.</p>
