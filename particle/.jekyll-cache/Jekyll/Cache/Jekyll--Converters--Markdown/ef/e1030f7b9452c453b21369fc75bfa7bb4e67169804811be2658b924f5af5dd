I"w<p>In Quantum Mechanics we define Quantum Systems by using the wavefunction (Ψ), which is a vector.
For example :– |Ψ&gt; = a |0&gt; + b |1&gt; + c |2&gt; ……
Here what we write in <strong>“ket”</strong> notation (|&gt;) are the possible quantum states and their coefficients are the probabilities for the particular states; these coefficients are complex numbers.</p>

<p>According to the <strong>Born Interpretation</strong> the square of the coefficients are the probabilities and also the sum of all the probabilities is 1. Let’s take an example :</p>

<p><strong>|Ψ&gt; = a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;</strong></p>

<p>now the probability of measuring state 0 = a.a*
and the probability of measuring state 1 = b.b*</p>

<p><strong>* = complex conjugate</strong></p>

<p>Now in order to understand decoherence let’s consider the system to be in superposition.</p>

<p><strong>|Ψ&gt; = (1/√2) |0&gt; + (1/√2) |1&gt;</strong>
probability of |0&gt; = 1/2
probability of |1&gt; = 1/2</p>

<p>If we add a complex number \exp{iθ} then it will not affect the probabilities because if it’s product with it’s conjugate will be 1.</p>
