    <p><h1>The Fourier Transform</h1>
<p>Posted on 30 Sep 2020 by ŒîŒ®œÜ</p>

<p>Hello üñê, I am sorry that you had to wait so long for my next post but the truth is that I had tons of homework from school, and I will do my best to be regular.
In this article I will be giving you an insight into the Fourier Transform. We‚Äôll be talking about the definition of The Fourier Transform later, first let‚Äôs talk about periodicity. Now what exactly is periodicity, it is the tendency of a particular phenomena to repeat at regular intervals. Periodicity is associated with symmetry.</p>

<p>In the case of The Fourier Transform we generally talk about periodicity in space and time. We can write any signal in terms of sinusoids because they are simple and periodic in nature. Let‚Äôs take a variable ‚Äút‚Äù which will represent the time domain, then sin(2œÄt) is also periodic. If we fix the period of a signal to be 1 then the sum of the signals must also have the same period because the whole pattern cannot repeat unless the longest pattern repeats. So let‚Äôs take the sum of signal.</p>
